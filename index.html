      <h2>About Nærbø</h2>
      <p>
        Nærbø is the largest village in Hå municipality with a population of 7
        336, in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located in the district
        of Jæren, about half-way between the town of Bryne and the village of
        Varhaug. The village sits about 38 kilometres south of Norway's fourth
        largest city, Stavanger. The village was the administrative centre of
        the old municipality of Nærbø from 1894 until 1964 when it was merged
        into Hå. The area around Nærbø is one of the most important agricultural
        areas of Norway with almost half of the land in the municipality being
        used for agricultural purposes. The area is sometimes referred to as the
        breadbasket of Norway because of its large agricultural sector.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The name Nærbø dates back to 1834 when the two local church
        congregations of Njærheim and Bø were amalgamated and the resulting
        congregation was called Nærbø. The church for this congregation was
        called the Nærbø Church (today called the Old Nærbø Church since the
        "new" Nærbø Church was built in 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
        Archaeologists have found traces of human activity dating back as far as
        6000 years B.C in the area. Most of these findings have been in the
        vicinity of the river Hå åna, which flows from the hills in the east of
        the municipality to the ocean in the west. These early inhabitants were
        mostly hunters that survived on fishing and small game hunting. The
        region also played an important part in the Viking Age (eighth to
        eleventh centuries).
      </p>
      <p>
        Nærbø is located about 35 kilometres south of the Hafrsfjorden, where in
        872 the Battle of Hafrsfjord took place. The western parts of Norway
        were unified under one monarch after this battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 968, Olav Trygvason, the King of Norway from 995 to 1000 was born in
        Obrestad just outside the village of Nærbø. Olav Trygvason played a big
        part in bringing Christianity to Norway and is believed to have built
        the first church in Norway in 995. He also founded the city of Trondheim
        in 997. In 1349, the Black Plague killed nearly 2/3rds of the population
        in the area. In 1878, the Jærbanen rail line was completed with Nærbø
        Station in this village.

        In 1940, the Germans invaded Norway and large areas of the coastline of
        Jæren was lined with high explosive mines. The Germans forced many of
        the Norwegian males in the area to work as labourers for the German
        occupying forces.

      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p>
        The region is an important agricultural area and subsequently a great
        proportion of the inhabitants are employed in the agricultural sector.
        The village has one of Norway's biggest dairies which produces
        82,200,000 litres of milk each year. The Tine dairy also makes the
        famous Jarlsberg and Norvegia cheeses, in addition to other dairy
        products. Risa group is run from Nærbø and has several facilities in
        Nærbø. The village also has an abattoir and local shopping centers.
        Because of Nærbø close proximity to the cities of Sandnes and Stavanger,
        it has attracted many new inhabitants from these two cities. This is
        mainly due to more affordable real estate prices in Nærbø, and a
        relatively short commute between Nærbø and Sandnes/Stavanger. Stavanger
        is approximately 38 kilometres away from Nærbø, and Sandnes is 25
        kilometres away.
